A super simple react component for creating grids. Uses the [fab four technique](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-fab-four-technique-to-create-responsive-emails-without-media-queries-baf11fdfa848) to eliminate the need for any media queries.

## Install

```shell
$ yarn add rfg
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Col from 'rfg'

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <Col size={4}>I'm in a 1/3 column.</Col>
    <Col size={8}>I'm in a 2/3 column.</Col>
  </div>
)

export default App
```
